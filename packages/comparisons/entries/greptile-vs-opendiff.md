# Greptile vs OpenDiff

Greptile and OpenDiff overlap in AI-assisted engineering, but they solve different day-to-day problems.

## Positioning

Greptile is often used for repository understanding and developer assistance. OpenDiff is optimized for enforcing review quality and preventing regressions before shipping.

## Where Greptile shines

- Navigating unfamiliar codebases
- Retrieving architecture context
- Faster onboarding for new teammates

## Where OpenDiff shines

- Consistent review feedback across PRs
- Policy-driven quality checks
- Automated fix loops tied to review findings

## Team impact

Most teams that choose one as a primary tool pick based on whether they need **knowledge retrieval** or **review enforcement** first. In practice, they can also be complementary.
