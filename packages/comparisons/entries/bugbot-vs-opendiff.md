# Bugbot vs OpenDiff

Bugbot and OpenDiff both target higher code quality with automation, but their operating model is different.

## Ownership model

Bugbot offers a more managed path. OpenDiff is open source and can be run with your own stack, which is useful for teams with strict governance requirements.

## Customization

If you need deep customization (rules, prompts, infra controls), OpenDiff usually gives more room. If you want a narrower, opinionated setup, Bugbot can feel simpler.

## Cost and scaling

At small scale, both are straightforward. At larger scale, total cost often depends on how much control you need over models, hosting, and review policy.

## Recommendation

Use Bugbot for convenience-first adoption. Use OpenDiff for control-first adoption and long-term extensibility.
