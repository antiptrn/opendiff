# How we write release deep dives

When we ship significant features, we publish a deep dive to explain the decisions behind them.

Our writing checklist is straightforward:

1. Start with the user problem.
2. Explain the architecture choices.
3. Show important edge cases.
4. Share what we would improve next.

Keeping content in markdown lets engineering, product, and design all collaborate in the same PR.
